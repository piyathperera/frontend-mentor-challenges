## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) - CSS Methodology
-   [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) - Fluid Types and Spacing
-   Responsive Design
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend Tooling
-   Javascript - Interactive Mobile menu

### What I learned

I learned to Be the browserâ€™s mentor, not its micromanager with help of [Andy Bell's Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uhIiI9Ld5M) and his [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) methodology helped to maintain CSS more readable, maintainable and create a good enough foundation for the content in any form of design with progressive enhancement in mind.

Design is more responsive with the help of [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) for its maths and magic to produce Fluid types for Font-sizes and Fluid spaces for padding, margins. Need to learn more about Design tokens in making them as well as using them in projects.

Accessibility is still a learning curve, gained a lot of insight into what needs to be considered for different browser and screen readers and steps to mitigate to represent the correct behavior of the content I produce. Icons Buttons, Buttons interactions and Navigations are on Top pirority. Also learn to navigation completed design with windows narrator: which helped in making well informed decisions on svg+link interactions.

Learned to add changes and decided not to make Pixel perfect designs as [Josh w Comeau's article](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/pixel-perfection/) perfectly laid out. Usability is one of main interesting areas that more website designs could improve upon. I changed Mobile Menu interation and Links appearing as underlined text. In Future, I wil make changes to make the design more accessible and usable for everyone. 

### Continued development

- Refactor and write more clean code.
- Change the Design more to adhere to well knowed Usability Principles.
- Accessibility and Test if everything works.
- Learning css animations to elements of the website.

### Useful resources

-   [CSS Gradient Generator](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/gradient-generator/) - Helped with button CTA styling with accent colors.

-   [Pixels and Accessibility](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/) - Helped to learn more about css units and how it affects a11y.

-   [A11y Images and SVGs (icons)](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/05/22/contextual-images-svgs-and-a11y.html) - This helped me to create a SVG icon button the right way with a11y.
